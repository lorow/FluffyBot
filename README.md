Fluffy bot is a general purpose bot, but mostly utility and fun based one. It allows you to listen to your favorite music, search for images on variety of websites all over the net and much more! 
Please note, it's still in development and some things may be not working or fully implemented yet.

**Features**

Fluffy is able to receive commands signed with '//' prefix. At this stage it can:
* generally search Google for what you need,
* play music from YT,
* show an image from the net,
* show reddit posts etc.,
* help you with your existential problems,
* help you got blessed by the God and much more...

**Planned to be added...**

Fluffy needs to have its functionalities extended. 

There are at least 3 things:
* better scoping of the commands so it will look like: <prefix> <command> <subcomms> <args> ,
* make all of functions working,
* administrator module,
* better admin UI,
* connect to postgresql database,  
* option of changing prefix.
